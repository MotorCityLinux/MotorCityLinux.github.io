	<h1>What is Motor City Linux all about?</h1>

<br>

<p>We are a non-profit, open source based organization established to create custom linux solutions for non-profit organizations in the Greater Detroit Metropolitan Area. When we say open source based organization I mean that the commits and contributors are the only things of which the organization is comprised. Of course, anyone can contribute to the projects, organization as a whole, or this very webpage. All materials and documents are to be hosted on this Organization's <a href="https://github.com/MotorCityLinux"><strong>GitHub</strong></a> account within the various repos.</p>

<p><strong>Motor City Linux</strong>, is not exclusively aligned with any other organization. As we said, it is what it is made of.
